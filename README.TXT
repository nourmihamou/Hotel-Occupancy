USER INSTRUCTIONS: In order to get the terminal window, the user will have to right-click on the HotelOccupancy class and select the main method. The next window will expect the user to fill in the parameters of hotel data as the first argument (args[0]) and the name of the desired output file to be written (args[1]). Then, user will be prompted to answer whether they would like to see all the available rooms. If so, they will be asked a series of preference questions. Once answered, the program will print the available rooms according to the preferences to the terminal window, as well onto a separate .txt file within the local drive where the program is saved.
